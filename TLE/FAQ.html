    <b>How early do we need to start planning an event?</b></button>
     <p>Whilst this obviously depends on the size and nature of the event,
        we’d always advise you to start putting plans in place as early as possible.
        At certain times of year certain venues may need to be booked well
         in advance, as too with reputable suppliers and vendors.
       We advise handing over the reins to an event planner as soon as
        you’re aware of an event to be planned.
        This gives us adequate time to factor in back up plans as
         well as leaving ample time to negotiate, plan
         and ensure everything’s in place for your big day.

       <b>What is your refund and cancellation policy?</b></button>
     <p>We’re aware that sometimes things happen which are outside
       of your control. In the event of needing a refund for a
      cancelled event, do discuss this with your event planner
      as early as possible, before extra services and products
      may have been ordered. We will discuss our policies
      with you before entering into contracts and then liaise
      with you in the unfortunate event of an event being canceled.</p>

   <i class="arrow down"></i>
       <b>What factors do you consider when selecting a venue?</b></button>
     <p>We consider the size and capacity of venue needed for
        the number of guests, facilities provided, parking,
       technical needs and budget constraints. We visit venues
        to check on the quality of the facilities and liaise with clients,
        keeping them informed of decisions made.</p>

       <b>What is your average fees?</b></button>
     <p>We will discuss all your event requirements
      before giving a quotation as obviously fees
      charged will depend on the scale and nature
      of the event, complexity of planning and our level of involvement.
       We’ll keep in contact with you regarding our time,
      hours spent, and liaise with you on specific items,
      but we’ll also work to your budget and plan accordingly.
      You’ll never be charged more than we agree upon and
       there will be no hidden extras or surprises.</p>

       <b>How do you keep budgets on track?</b></button>
     <p>We are meticulous about keeping track of everything
        we need to spend money on. This is done by constant
         monitoring and updating spreadsheets, knowing where
         to prioritise spending and keeping aside a budget to
          cater for emergency contingencies.</p>

         <b>Can you cope with last minute changes of plan or emergency situations?</b></button>
     <p>We have extensive experience in dealing with the unexpected.
       We build in contingency measures for all our events and are
        constantly formulating plans to cope with emergency situations.
         Rest assured your event is always in the most capable hands.</p>

        to speak with one of our friendly event planners today.

      <b>How Do I Get A Career In The Events Industry?</b></button>

     the most important elements to make them work ready.</p>

      <b>Can I get a consultation? What does it cost?</b></button>
    <p>Of course! We’d never dream of trying to plan
       your event without making sure we know just
       want you’re looking for and how to proceed.
       There is no consultation fee that will
       be waived if you decided to move ahead with
       the event.  Although we
       seriously doubt this would happen we need to
       anticipate all eventualities.</p>

       and personal events. These range from product launches,
       conferences and company award evenings to celebratory

      <b>How do you select the vendors?</b></button>
    <p>We are very close to many quality vendors in the
      Bangalore through our long experience with party
      planning and other events we have produced.
      Securing each vendor and making sure they are tops
      in their fields and have all needed licenses/insurance
      is an important part of our job. Also, we love to work
      with vendors who are fun to partner with and believe
      that this makes the entire planning process easier all around.</p>
